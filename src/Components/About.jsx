          Iâ€™m a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong focus on building
          dynamic and responsive web applications using React JS. With a solid
          foundation in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, I craft
          seamless user experiences that are not only visually appealing but
          also highly functional. I enjoy leveraging modern libraries like GSAP
          to bring interactivity and animations to life, ensuring every project
          stands out. My goal is to continuously evolve my skills and deliver
          high-quality code that meets both user needs and business objectives.
